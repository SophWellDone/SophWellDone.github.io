I realised that, to make it match the ships background, making a copy of the background sprite would be a good place to start as the alpha would already match. Then all I had to do was make a quick shader set the alpha above a certain UV y-coordinate that defines how full the ship is, so anything above a certain point was transparent.</p><p>This meant I had to do a bit of maths to convert between how high I wanted the water to be physically in the game, and then send that to the water shader to calculate where that position would lie within the UV</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://sophwelldone.github.io/media/posts/3/Untitled-2.png" height="727" width="1294" alt="" sizes="(min-width: 37.5em) 1600px, 80vw" srcset="https://sophwelldone.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/Untitled-2-xs.png 384w, https://sophwelldone.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/Untitled-2-sm.png 600w, https://sophwelldone.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/Untitled-2-md.png 768w, https://sophwelldone.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/Untitled-2-lg.png 1200w, https://sophwelldone.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/Untitled-2-xl.png 1600w"><figcaption>A y-position in pixels goes in, a UV is calculated and used for the shader</figcaption></figure><p>I was implementing this change, but realised it was somewhat unnecessary. As I wanted to define the time in seconds it takes to fill the ship fully rather than the 'pixels per second' of the water rising, i could just use my existing variable and pass that directly to the shader.</p><pre class="language-gdscript"><code>func _process(delta: float) -&gt; void:

The last thing i wanted to do was to add a bit of maths to stop the water looking too flat. I decided to use the old reliable - sine waves - to add a slight ripple to the interior water. All this does is move the 'cut off uv coordinate' for making the pixel invisible. The shader itself is only&nbsp;</p><pre class="language-glsl"><code>// This is a 2D shader for the interior water of the ship.

</code></pre><p>This shader is one of my favourite parts about this game. It creates a really convincing effect when shown in the final game, as the water inside the ship has its own separate<strong></strong> waves and height. It helps it feels more like a room that is flooding rather than just a copy of the ocean outside that is moved up or down.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://sophwelldone.github.io/media/posts/3/SinWAVES.gif" height="859" width="1497" alt=""><figcaption>Playing with the progress and wave height variables!</figcaption></figure><h2 id="additional-water-details">Additional Water Details</h2><p>There is two additional detail to this games 'interior water' inside the ship. Firstly, I mapped the water below the waves to a slight gradient, making the bottom of the water darker.</p><p>The other main detail is that the cannonball holes were given particles that adapt to the waters height. If the water is low, leaking water particles are shown dropping into the water as it slowly fills. If the water is higher than the cannonball hole, however, it will actually create bubble particles as trapped air rushes through the hole from the outside. This small change added such a realistic effect and create a sense of urgency and panic as the bubbles begin to rise. I'm super happy with how they look!</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://sophwelldone.github.io/media/posts/3/BubblesVERYFANCY.gif" height="650" width="1154" alt=""><figcaption>Droplets turn to bubbles - we're going down!!</figcaption></figure><p>One of my biggest regrets with this game is never getting round to music and SFX, because a rushing bubbling sound would really help sell the effect even more.</p><h2 id="navy-boarders">Navy Boarders</h2><p>This devlog is getting long and I still want to talk about the difficulty and the extremely stressful final morning, so I'll keep this section short since the code is quite simple. That being, the boarders will follow a path at a set speed and if they reach the end of the path you loose. The main time sink for them was animating. To stick with the anthropromorphic theme of the characters, I chose my second favourite animal - cats - to be the boarders!</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://sophwelldone.github.io/media/posts/3/NavyAnimations.gif" height="755" width="923" alt=""><figcaption>Reusing animation is much more efficient!</figcaption></figure><p>Most of their animations are reused from the player, the only difference being a fall animation replacing the jump and giving them a custom head shape and colour palette to match.&nbsp;</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://sophwelldone.github.io/media/posts/3/ProgressLastNight.gif" height="650" width="1154" alt=""></figure><p>This was my progress on the last night before the deadline. The animations were all implemented, although whacking them off the ship didn't quite work yet. Oh, and the weird Godot robot face in the floor was the nail trap mechanic where you could use nails to slow down boarders. Unfortunately I never got time to finalise so it was scrapped!</p><h2 id="difficulty">Difficulty</h2><p>So how do you make a fun difficulty curve for an endless game? You've already read the answer I landed on - <em>curves</em>! Godot has a really nice inbuilt resource called a Curve2D that lets you create and sample 2D Bezier curves.</p><p>All the difficulty does is sample curves, where the x axis is set to the time since the game started in minutes and the y axis is some value that gets harder to keep up with (shorter time between holes breaking, faster water fill speed etc.)</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://sophwelldone.github.io/media/posts/3/difficulties-2.png" height="723" width="256" alt="" sizes="(min-width: 37.5em) 1600px, 80vw" srcset="https://sophwelldone.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/difficulties-2-xs.png 384w, https://sophwelldone.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/difficulties-2-sm.png 600w, https://sophwelldone.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/difficulties-2-md.png 768w, https://sophwelldone.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/difficulties-2-lg.png 1200w, https://sophwelldone.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/difficulties-2-xl.png 1600w"><figcaption>A snippet of difficulties - example explained below is in red brackets!</figcaption></figure><p>In the example above, the Cannon Hole Break Timer curve starts at (0.0, 45.0). This means that, at 0.0 minutes into the game, it takes a whole 45 seconds for a cannon hole to break after being repaired. This curve descends as time goes on, making the break happen faster and faster and therefore the game harder. At the end of the curve, (7.0, 10.59), we have reached the maximum break speed, with repairs only lasting a measly 10.59 seconds.</p><p>Most of the games main variables that involve time and tasks follow curves, the main exception being nails *always* adding 5.0s to the timer before one of you repairs break since it is already a small number.</p><h2 id="the-messtm">The mess™️</h2><p>This is where everything fell apart for the last few hours. I learned a very important lesson with this since it almost cost my entry to the jam entirely - <b>Do NOT leave your export until the last few hours!</b></p><p>My game would work fine in the editor but, upon exporting it and playing it on itch.io, it completely broke. The game would load but nothing would happen - the water was full, you couldn't repair anything, no holes broke and no navy boarders appeared. After spending the last few hours of the jam frantically trying to cross reference errors and scripts, it all lead to the most recent updates to the difficulty. I finally found the error below</p><pre class="language-gdscript"><code>load(some_resource_type) #THIS IS BAD AND ONLY WORKS IN EDITOR FOR RESOURCES! 
# When game is  exported the custom resources are
# converted to binary and have a different file location/type.

ResourceLoader.load(some_resource_type) #this is what I should have used!


</code></pre><p>and implementing this tiny change fixed everything. With that one line of code, I could finally relax for the first time in 3 days.</p><h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2><p>A few days pass, I try a few of the other games and they are really fun! I like to leave a balanced comment with both what I like and my personal suggestion</p><p>Overall, I am extremely happy I both had this opportunity and decided to participate. Game jams are such a close thing to my heart due to so many reasons - the great community and networking opportunities, the forced creativity of having a theme and time limit, the constructive feedback, the friendly competition. It's everything you need to both get the motivation and iterative comments / advice for making a game and I will always highly recommend joining them for any person interested in any role in the games industry.</p><p>Thanks for reading my little devlog/recounting/tutorial(?),</p><p>Sophie&nbsp;</p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="content__tag-share"><div class="content__tag"><h3 class="content__tag__title">Posted in</h3><ul class="content__tag__list"><li><a href="https://sophwelldone.github.io/tags/2025/">2025</a></li><li><a href="https://sophwelldone.github.io/tags/game-jams/">Game Jams</a></li></ul></div><div class="content__share"></div></div></footer></div></article><div class="content__related"><h3 class="content__related__title">Related posts</h3><div class="l-grid l-grid--2"><article class="c-card"><div class="c-card__wrapper"><figure class="c-card__image is-img-loading"><img src="https://sophwelldone.github.io/media/posts/2/THWACKED.png" srcset="https://sophwelldone.github.io/media/posts/2/responsive/THWACKED-xs.png 384w, https://sophwelldone.github.io/media/posts/2/responsive/THWACKED-sm.png 600w, https://sophwelldone.github.io/media/posts/2/responsive/THWACKED-md.png 768w, https://sophwelldone.github.io/media/posts/2/responsive/THWACKED-lg.png 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 37.5em) 80vw, 50vw" loading="lazy" height="459" width="606" alt=""></figure><div class="c-card__content"><header><h2 class="c-card__title"><a href="https://sophwelldone.github.io/planking-boarders.html" class="invert">Planking Boarders Devlog #1 - Intro + First Half</a></h2></header><footer class="c-card__meta"><a href="https://sophwelldone.github.io/tags/2025/" class="c-card__tag">2025</a></footer></div></div></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__left"><div class="footer__copy">Powered by Publii</div></div><div class="footer__right"><div class="footer__social"><a href="skullbunss." aria-label="Instagram" class="instagram"><svg><use xlink:href="https://sophwelldone.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#instagram"/></svg></a></div></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://sophwelldone.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = { mobileMenuMode: 'sidebar', animationSpeed: 300, submenuWidth: 'auto', doubleClickTime: 500, mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus: true, relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector: '.navbar', };</script><script defer="defer" src="https://sophwelldone.github.io/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=59269328060dc70acb340c4b9dccbcde"></script><script>function publiiDetectLoadedImages () {
