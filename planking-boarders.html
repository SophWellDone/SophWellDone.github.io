After competing in 10s of game jams before starting my course, it was extremely fulfilling to have all that past experience lead me to win this jam in my very first year!</p><p>The rest of this post and following posts are essentially a small devlog of the first half of how I made my entry including the design process, any issues I faced and how I resolved them.</p><h1 id="day-1">Day 1</h1><p>During the first year of my game design course, I attended the yearly GameX conference. Guest speakers from across the game industry - developers, designers, voice actors - are all invited in to talk and answer questions about their experiences in industry. This was already a really fun and educational experience, but the real cherry on top personally was learning that as part the games course lecturers were hosting a game jam open to all students - GameX Jam 2025!</p><p>I knew I had to enter it. I decided I would try tackling this one solo, I had done several game jams before this one alone and decided that I would find it easier to do so considering how short the 3 day deadline was. On the last day of the event, the theme was unveiled - 'Boarders'.</p><h2 id="brainstorming-and-planning">Brainstorming and Planning</h2><p>Usually when I am told it's theme, I like to create and suggest a few ideas for a game jam entry. Then, I/we pick the teams overall favourite and focus on just that one. This time, however, I immediately had two ideas before I even left the conference hall that felt like they would work perfectly together.</p><ol><li>Boarders as in people <b>boarding </b>a pirate ship Pirates of the Caribbean style.</li><li>Boarders as in people desperately <b>boarding </b>up cannonball holes in a ship to keep it afloat.</li></ol><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://sophwelldone.github.io/media/posts/2/unnamed.jpg" height="512" width="236" alt="" sizes="(min-width: 37.5em) 1600px, 80vw" srcset="https://sophwelldone.github.io/media/posts/2/responsive/unnamed-xs.jpg 384w, https://sophwelldone.github.io/media/posts/2/responsive/unnamed-sm.jpg 600w, https://sophwelldone.github.io/media/posts/2/responsive/unnamed-md.jpg 768w, https://sophwelldone.github.io/media/posts/2/responsive/unnamed-lg.jpg 1200w, https://sophwelldone.github.io/media/posts/2/responsive/unnamed-xl.jpg 1600w"><figcaption>Screenshot of my phone with all the ideas buzzing through my head immediately after the announcement!</figcaption></figure><p>The game loop I was imagining was meant to be silly and stressful at the same time, like something you would see in an animated kids cartoon. The rules of the game were:</p><ul><li>The goal of the game is to keep the ship afloat as long as possible.</li><li>To achieve this goal, you must successfully complete tasks such as repairs to delay the ship sinking.</li><li>Each task takes time to physically travel to.</li><li>The game is single player, so you must decide what order every task is approached</li><li>The difficulty comes from prioritising what order to do tasks on the fly as new ones pop up faster and faster.</li><li><s>A minigame should be present for each task to add more skill to the game</s></li></ul><p>I laid out a few more quick aesthetic design choices that enforced this intended experience, such as making the game 2D and the characters anthropomorphic animals - really just hone in on the Looney Tunes vibes!</p><p>Programming wise, it was a 3 day game jam with no restriction on tools used. This meant I was almost certainly going to use the Godot engine as the game engine and GDscript for the code due to my personal experience and preference. Godot is also very lightweight to allow for quickly iterating on, building and testing my games mechanics.</p><h3 id="game-design">Game Design</h3><p>As the main goal of the game is managing your time based on where you are and how long it takes to get somewhere, I started by designing the physical space where all of these rules would take place - the ship!</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://sophwelldone.github.io/media/posts/2/Screenshot-2025-03-14-190811.png" height="601" width="877" alt="" sizes="(min-width: 37.5em) 1600px, 80vw" srcset="https://sophwelldone.github.io/media/posts/2/responsive/Screenshot-2025-03-14-190811-xs.png 384w, https://sophwelldone.github.io/media/posts/2/responsive/Screenshot-2025-03-14-190811-sm.png 600w, https://sophwelldone.github.io/media/posts/2/responsive/Screenshot-2025-03-14-190811-md.png 768w, https://sophwelldone.github.io/media/posts/2/responsive/Screenshot-2025-03-14-190811-lg.png 1200w, https://sophwelldone.github.io/media/posts/2/responsive/Screenshot-2025-03-14-190811-xl.png 1600w"><figcaption>An empty ship with two decks to help spread everything out!</figcaption></figure><p>I realised here that I could have one task for each of the two decks. This keeps the game simple to make as I only need to write code and make assets for two tasks, but also keeps the game easy to learn for people who are quickly trying out all the game jam entries. Below is an update the diagram above, with sketches and text to explain what the two tasks are and what the loss condition is.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://sophwelldone.github.io/media/posts/2/ShipConcept1.png" height="2480" width="3508" alt="" sizes="(min-width: 37.5em) 1600px, 80vw" srcset="https://sophwelldone.github.io/media/posts/2/responsive/ShipConcept1-xs.png 384w, https://sophwelldone.github.io/media/posts/2/responsive/ShipConcept1-sm.png 600w, https://sophwelldone.github.io/media/posts/2/responsive/ShipConcept1-md.png 768w, https://sophwelldone.github.io/media/posts/2/responsive/ShipConcept1-lg.png 1200w, https://sophwelldone.github.io/media/posts/2/responsive/ShipConcept1-xl.png 1600w"><figcaption>The ship layout sketched. Each deck has its own task, and each task can cause the player to lose if not dealt with.</figcaption></figure><p>This was where mentally visualising the game became much easier. I imagined a player patching a leaking cannonball hole before dashing up to whack a boarder of the ship, only to immediately run back downstairs to patch another hole that just split open again.</p><p>To add a little more complexity to the game, I added planks and nails as physical resources used when completing tasks. This may have been one of my bigger mistakes as it created new UI, variables and assets I was already going to struggle to get done. It was like adding a new task but for the creation of the game, not the game itself! However, it did make the game more complex without adding minigames which would have been even worse.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://sophwelldone.github.io/media/posts/2/ShipConcept2.png" height="2480" width="3508" alt="" sizes="(min-width: 37.5em) 1600px, 80vw" srcset="https://sophwelldone.github.io/media/posts/2/responsive/ShipConcept2-xs.png 384w, https://sophwelldone.github.io/media/posts/2/responsive/ShipConcept2-sm.png 600w, https://sophwelldone.github.io/media/posts/2/responsive/ShipConcept2-md.png 768w, https://sophwelldone.github.io/media/posts/2/responsive/ShipConcept2-lg.png 1200w, https://sophwelldone.github.io/media/posts/2/responsive/ShipConcept2-xl.png 1600w"><figcaption>Introducing barrels to the game</figcaption></figure><p>The planks were the most important resource, and would be used to either repair a hole or whack a boarder off the ship completely. The catch was that you could only carry one plank and only use it once before needing to return to a wood barrel to restock. Nails were similar, but had multiple uses and would delay rather than complete a task. This was reinforcing your wooden repairs in the bottom deck, or laying out nail traps to slow the boarders on the top deck - the latter never saw the light of the day due to running out of time.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="prototyping">Prototyping</h2><h3 id="ship-hull-and-platforms">Ship Hull and Platforms</h3><p>With the design now fleshed out, I started the whiteboxing process of making it in the game engine.

This helps keep the game a bit more predictable when playing and also when designing the conditions for the endless difficulty as there is no random 'spawn locations' each time a hole appears that could make that hole much quicker or slower to repair.</p><h4 id="repairs">Repairs</h4><p>Cannonballs have 3 states - open, boarded and boarded and nailed. The last two ended up being essentially the same, as nails only add some time before the board breaks, with the only difference being the sprite. The ship only fills when it the hole is open. Because of the calculation below, most of the code associated with each cannonball is just changing the sprite and adding the UI to show your current materials.&nbsp;</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://sophwelldone.github.io/media/posts/2/WaterStopping.gif" height="650" width="1154" alt=""></figure><h4 id="fill-speed-calculation">Fill Speed Calculation</h4><p>As shown in the previous water code snippet, there is a function for calculating the fill progress per second. If I just multiplied the speed of water filling the ship, x, by the number of holes, it would linearly increase - one hole would do x% per second, two holes would do 2x% per second and zero holes would not fill the ship as 0 * x is just 0. This is fine, but quite unforgiving if multiple holes break open in quick succession.</p><p>Instead of linearly increasing, the fill speed is calculated based on a predetermined curve. The values below are the array that the get_fill_per_second() function uses.</p><pre class="line-numbers language-gdscript"><code># stops multiple holes being unfairly quick (2x, 3x, 4x etc.)
var fill_speed_multiplier : Array[float] = [
	0.0, #0 holes
	1.0, #1 hole
	1.6, #2 holes, so on..
	2.0
]</code></pre><h2 id="first-assets">First Assets</h2><p>To finish day one, I started making some assets for the player. Doing nothing but code was tiring, and it was nice to get a big complex task like animating all the walking and jumping done ASAP.</p><p>I knew the characters resolution would be about 128x64 pixels due to the collision shapes size. I also quickly decided on using Aseprite to make the pixel art for the game as it is both familiar and very good at creating sprite sheets to add animations in the engine.</p><div class="gallery-wrapper"><div class="gallery" data-columns="3"><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://sophwelldone.github.io/media/posts/2/gallery/char.png" data-size="512x367"><img loading="lazy" src="https://sophwelldone.github.io/media/posts/2/gallery/char-thumbnail.png" height="367" width="512" alt="An outline for the character, and it fits the collision shape!"></a></figure></div></div><p>Now knowing the sprite fits, I moved on to animation. I created the character with basic and disconnected round shapes as it is much easier to animate their limbs since i only need to move the position of each layer (left hand, right hand etc.) and slightly alter the shape to give a convincing motion effect.
