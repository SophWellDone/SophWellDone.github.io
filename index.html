<h2>Game Jams</h2>
<p>Ever since 2022 I have been an avid fan of entering game jams. They are what gave me the skills, motiviation and feedback to make games even before my University course. 
I have done game jams with varying time limits, ranging from 3 hours to several weeks. I will usually participate either solo in small teams.

<h3 class="project_title">Planking Boarders</h3>
<p class="project_description"> Planking Boarders is the winning entry I made solo for the 2025 GameX jam - a game jam the University of Gloucestershire annually hosts. I am very proud of this accomplishment, as I only had
3 days solo to brainstorm, design, program and make assets for it!</p>

<h2>Higher Education</h2>
<h3> University of Gloucestershire - Undergraduate Games Design (Full Time) </h3>
<p> I took this course to fill in the gaps in my knowledge about more theoretical aspects of game design, such as designing a fun user experience and the theory behind level design. However, I 
also very much enjoy the additional creative skills the course has taught me, such as 3D modelling and 2d Animation. It was also what introduced me to the many of the Adobe suite of products,
using software such as Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Substance Painter and Adobe Premiere Pro to create my coursework. </p>
